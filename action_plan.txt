### 30-60-90 Day Action Plan for Homeward

### 30-Day Focus: Learning and Foundational Contribution

The goals for the first month are focused on deep learning and establishing trust.

*   **Learn the business and systems:** Internalize culture from product and ops standups, shadow agent calls, and review recent incidents to understand the cash-offer, mortgage, and title workflows. I will map how the backend services, Salesforce, and underwriting tools interact and document my findings.
*   **Build relationships:** I will schedule weekly 1:1s with leads in Engineering, Product, Ops, and Compliance. I'll also set up virtual ride-alongs with partner agents to understand their daily workflows and challenges.
*   **Establish baseline metrics:** I will create a simple observability scorecard using existing dashboards in CI/CD and New Relic/Datadog. This will track metrics like deployment frequency, MTTR, and cost-per-transaction to measure the impact of future work.
*   **Review current AI/automation:** I'll take inventory of existing AI/automation experiments, tools, and processes to identify opportunities and understand current capabilities.
*   **Get an early win:** I will identify and fix a tangible issue in a backend component, such as optimizing a slow query or improving a flaky test suite, and share the fix with the team through a brief write-up and demo.

### 60-Day Focus: Prototyping and Planning

The second month shifts focus to creating a tangible prototype and planning the first major initiative.

*   **Focus on a core prototype:** Design and build a working prototype of a RAG service for internal knowledge. The goal is to create a compelling demo for underwriting and operations teams to showcase potential value and gather early feedback.
*   **Plan the first major project:** Using the system knowledge gained in the first month, I will investigate the offer generation process. I will then propose a data-backed plan to the relevant teams for a project in the next quarter aimed at reducing offer cycle time.
*   **Improve a critical workflow:** I will identify one of the most problematic ad-hoc background jobs and refactor it for better reliability and observability. This will serve as a pilot for a potential larger-scale workflow engine migration.
*   **Continue strengthening the SDLC:** I will continue working with the team to integrate better testing and static analysis tools into the CI pipeline and help define development best practices.
*   **Establish data feedback loops:** I will work with the Analytics team to begin creating dashboards for key business and engineering metrics identified in the first month.

### 90-Day Focus: Execution and Strategic Influence

The third month is focused on executing the planned project and beginning to shape long-term strategy.

*   **Lead a key business initiative:** I will execute on the "offer cycle time" project planned in the previous month. The goal is to work with the Mortgage and Title teams to implement the proposed changes and deliver a measurable improvement.
*   **Validate and plan the AI service rollout:** Based on feedback from the prototype, I will refine the AI knowledge service. I will develop a detailed production-readiness plan, including cost estimates, security reviews, and a phased rollout strategy for a future quarter.
*   **Develop a strategic automation roadmap:** I will create and present a roadmap for future automation projects, including business cases and proposed OKRs to help leadership prioritize technical investments.
*   **Mentor and grow the team:** I will continue to invest in the team's growth by: leading a backend brown-bag monthly presentation to the engineerning team on relevant technologies; pair-programming on complex problems; and contributing to career development frameworks.
*   **Propose a long-term technical vision:** I will synthesize the learnings from the first 90 days into a 6-12 month technical modernization proposal for leadership, tying all recommendations to business outcomes.
